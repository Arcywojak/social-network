# Very simple version of social-network

## Project available [here](https://almost-social-network.herokuapp.com/welcome) on Heroku.  

# Technologies which contributed to this project:  
1) Front-end / design:  
-react,  
-redux,  
-sass,  
-figma;   
2) Back-end:  
-node JS,  
-MongoDB;

# What is the project?
It is simple social network where, after register you are able to:
-add posts,  
-comment posts,
-according to post go to author's profile
And there are also few particular subpages like about/contact/regulations/404;

# What could be also done in that project?
Everything which is on random social network like adding friends, searching users, deleting posts/accounts and so on, but in very simple edition. There are also unhandled bugs like, for example user profile without user being found (and maybe somthing that I'm not aware of).

# What I'm not proud of?
There are no tests (unfortunately I'm not used to them...yet...);  
I found it hard to mantain such a big ammount of code and I didn't manage to keep this clean and well organised (It is only my humble opinion, perhaps, in fact, it is not true ;) );
